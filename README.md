# Hekyll
_pronunciation: "heckle"_

Authored by: Brian McMurray (bmcmurray) and Steven Merrill (smerrill)

Hekyll is a presentation generator that uses [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) and [Impress.js](https://github.com/bartaz/impress.js) to create awesome presentations. You write [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) files, which get turned into individual slides for an Impress.js presentation.

## Design Goals

Hekyll should:

- Make it easy for hackers to write graphically-impressive presentations in Markdown.
- Allow easier collaboration on these presentations through GitHub.
- Allow users to commit and publish their presentations through GitHub using GitHub Pages.
- Provide a good print stylesheet so that a user can print to PDF when conferences ask for slide decks.
